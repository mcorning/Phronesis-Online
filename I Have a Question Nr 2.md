## There's a new game in town
We are experimenting with a new game all of us can play in an hour here at the shop.

We call it **I Have a Question.**

### Game #1
Game #1 on October 16, 2025 had five people join the discussion to answer the question: **What is the difference between Trust and Belief?**

## Game #2
**October 30, 2025 at 6-7Apm** 

Add a tick-mark below if you plan to join us as we discover the answer to the question of the evening. See you then.
