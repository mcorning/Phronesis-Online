## 0–5 Feet: Immediate Zone
- Remove leaves, pine needles, and other flammable debris from roofs, gutters, decks, porches, and stairs.  
- Clear vegetation and combustible mulch within five feet of the home’s foundation and attachments.  
- Relocate wood piles, propane tanks, and furniture cushions outside this zone when fire risk is high.  
- Use non-combustible materials (gravel, rock, or bare soil) for landscaping next to structures.  
- Seal gaps where embers could enter—roof edges, fascia, and joints around siding.

## 5–30 Feet: Intermediate Zone
- Maintain at least five feet of separation between tree crowns.  
- Remove ladder fuels: prune lower branches up six to ten feet from the ground.  
- Keep grass mowed to under four inches and watered when possible.  
- Replace flammable ground cover (juniper, bark mulch) with fire-resistant plants or materials.  
- Store outdoor equipment, lumber, and other combustibles away from structures.  
- Screen or box-in areas below decks with 1/8-inch metal mesh.  

## 30–100 Feet: Extended Zone
- Thin trees to create spacing of at least ten feet between crowns.  
- Dispose of slash piles, dead trees, and heavy accumulations of downed limbs.  
- Maintain driveways and access routes clear of flammable vegetation.  
- Ensure your address numbers are visible from the road for emergency responders.  
- Keep propane and fuel tanks cleared of vegetation for at least ten feet around.  

## Building-Envelope Hardening
- Replace or repair loose or missing shingles or roof tiles.  
- Install 1/8-inch metal mesh on vents in eaves, attics, and crawl spaces.  
- Repair or replace damaged or loose window screens and any broken windows.  
- Consider upgrading to dual-pane or tempered-glass windows.  
- Use metal flashing at roof-wall intersections and deck-to-wall junctions.  
- Replace sections of wooden fence attached directly to the home with metal or masonry.  

## Preparedness & Maintenance
- Keep garden hoses attached and long enough to reach all areas of the home.  
- Maintain defensible space yearly—check each zone at the start of fire season.  
- Review evacuation routes and emergency contact information with household members.  
- Register for county emergency alerts (Deschutes County Alert System).  
- Have fire extinguishers readily available and ensure all adults know how to use them.
