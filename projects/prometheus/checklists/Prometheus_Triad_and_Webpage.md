## **Prometheus: Wildfire Mitigation Praxis for Sisters**

Prometheus is the wildfire resilience initiative of **The Phronesis Project**, created to translate fire science into clear, actionable steps any homeowner can use.

Our approach is organized into a simple triad:

### **1. The Roadmap**  
A sequenced plan showing which actions reduce ignition risk fastest, starting with decks and the 0–5 foot ignition zone.

### **2. The Checklist**  
A field-ready set of criteria for homeowners, inspectors, and insurers. It consolidates Allstate, County WUI, NFPA 1144, and IBHS/CalFire into one unified standard.

### **3. The Crosswalk**  
The proof: a line-by-line alignment showing that all major authorities already agree on these mitigation requirements.

Together, the triad provides clarity, consistency, and confidence for the entire community.

## **Prometheus Innovations**

Prometheus also develops practical, low-cost innovations that enhance existing standards:

### **• Ember Grate**  
Replace the first deck board with a 6-inch metal mesh panel to eliminate ember traps at the wall.

### **• Deck Sprinklers (Pre-evacuation)**  
Place sprinklers on your deck before leaving to create a cooling, ember-extinguishing microclimate.

### **• Open Deck Gates**  
Break the combustible pathway along wooden railings and eliminate heat pockets.

These innovations complement the triad and provide powerful last-minute structure protection.
