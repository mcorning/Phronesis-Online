# Wildfire Deck Mitigation — Commission Briefing Slide

## The Three Principles
1. **No direct fuel contact** with the house (flashing, separations, breaks)  
2. **No ember entry points** (mesh, enclosure, clearance, cleanliness)  
3. **No combustible mass** within the 0–5 ft zone

## Critical Fixes for Decks

### 1. Deck-to-Wall Flashing
- Continuous metal flashing  
- 2" vertical rise  
- 1" horizontal overhang  
- Eliminates wood-to-siding ignition path  

### 2. Underside Enclosure (<4 ft)
- 1/8" metal mesh or non-combustible paneling  
- Prevents embers collecting under deck  
- Removes hidden ignition zone  

### 3. Railing & Stair Interfaces
- 1" clearance OR flashing  
- Stops fire travel along attached components  

### 4. Fence Connection
- Metal flashing OR non-combustible break  
- Wood fences act as fuse-lines unless interrupted

## Why This Matters
- 0–5 ft zone accounts for **80–90%** of home ignition risk  
- Embers travel miles; decks catch before vegetation  
- These fixes collectively reduce deck ignition probability by **>70%** (IBHS WPH)

## What We Are Asking
**Adopt or endorse this unified standard for deck mitigation**:  
- Flashing: 2" rise / 1" overhang  
- 1/8" mesh for decks <4 ft  
- 1" separation or metal break at all connections  
- 6" ground clearance  
- 0–5 ft non-combustible zone  

This aligns Allstate + IBHS + NFPA + CalFire and provides a workable, local standard.
