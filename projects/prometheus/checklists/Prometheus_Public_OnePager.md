# Three Structural Fire Breaks for Homeowners (Prometheus Public Guide)

## 1. Ember Grate
Replace the first deck board with a 6" metal mesh panel.
- Drops embers away from siding
- Prevents accumulation at wall interface
- Improves drainage and airflow

## 2. Deck Sprinklers
Before evacuating, place sprinklers on the deck and turn them on.
- Keeps deck above ignition moisture threshold
- Extinguishes embers on contact
- Cools siding and flashing

## 3. Open Deck Gates
Open all deck gates, especially wooden ones, before evacuation.
- Breaks the combustible railing pathway
- Eliminates heat/ember traps
- Enhances airflow and sprinkler coverage

These three actions provide powerful last-minute structure protection and integrate seamlessly with all County, NFPA, IBHS, and insurer wildfire standards.
