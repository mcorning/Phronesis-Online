**The Good Life**  
_Main Entrance to the Rabbit Warren_

What is the goal of an economy?  
Walter Isaacson recently posed this question, noting that growth and wealth are not the destination. They are the _precursors_ to something deeper: community, fulfillment, purpose. What he really asked was:

> **How can economies help people live the Good Life?**

But in asking that, he **begs the question**—because he assumes we know what makes a life good.

Ironically, as former leader of the [Aspen Institute]()https://www.aspeninstitute.org/, Isaacson does know. But most people haven’t read Aristotle. They haven’t encountered the framework of **eudaimonia**, or the deep connection between **virtue, habit, and happiness**.

That’s why this Warren begins here.

**The Good Life** is our _poster child_ project. It invites people into philosophy not by reading a whole book, but by stepping into the **questions that shape a life**:

- What does it mean to flourish?
    
- What is worth striving for?
    
- How do we spend our time, money, and energy wisely?
    

Our experiment last Thursday was one way in. A civic act. A real-time, public exploration of Aristotle’s ethics **without requiring prerequisites**.

This is the Warren at work:

- Taking old wisdom seriously
    
- Making it actionable
    
- Inviting people to think together about what matters most
    

**[[Enter Here]].** The Good Life awaits.
