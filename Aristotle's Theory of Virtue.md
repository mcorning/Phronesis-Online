## Aristotle's Theory of Virtue
In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle explores goodness, virtue, habit, and happiness. Indeed, some hold that it's Aristotle's definition of happiness cited in the Preamble to the US Constitution.

In our work we focus on three attributes of human behavior:
 - Courage
 - Temperance
 - Justice
Together we hold that wisdom only comes in the effect of all three influences. Aristotle referred to this kind of wisdom as *phronesis*. And this is the foundation of the Phronesis Projects. Each Project shows how to use *phronesis* in three spheres of life:

- civics in [[Agora]]
- education (which we define as personal development) in [[Praxis]]
- finance in [[Janus]]

The end result is what the ancients called **The Good Life**.

By extension, if everybody lived this Good Life, we would all live in a Good Society. But as the Founders noted, "If all men were angels we wouldn't need government." 

So let's strive to be like angels, shall we?
