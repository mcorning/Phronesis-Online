## The Phronesis Projects
### Mission Statement

The Phronesis Projects is a nonprofit created after the 2024 election. It was one person's answer to a perceived crisis for the American democracy.

Our missions are implemented in appropriate ways to have the right impact for the right number of people at the right time for each of them.

At this writing, we have three Projects in development:
- The Agora: Delivered in person at community events.
- Praxis: Online surveys returning research-based scores for practical wisdom.
- Janus: An Obsidian vault for managing personal finance for Social Security Income recipients.


> Your Imaginary Friends

> There is a place for artificial intelligence in each of these projects, and each one will show how they work and where they fit to extend mental and technical capabilities.
