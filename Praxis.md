  <h4>Pronunciation of <em>Praxis</em></h4>
  <p>
    The emphasis in <strong>“Praxis”</strong> is on the <strong>first syllable</strong>:<br>
    <strong>Prax-is</strong> — <code>/ˈpræksɪs/</code><br>
    Pronounced <strong>PRAK-sis</strong> (not <em>PRAY-xees</em> or <em>PRAX-iss</em>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Etymology &amp; sense:</strong> From Greek <em>πρᾶξις</em> (<em>prâxis</em>) “action; doing.”
    In contrast to <em>theory</em> (<em>theoría</em>), <em>praxis</em> is action guided by reflection—practice that
    embodies learning and values.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Project nuance:</strong> We use <em>Praxis</em> for the hands-on tools, surveys, and
    implementations that translate ideas into real-world behavior and measurable outcomes.

## Context
The Praxis Project interacts with all the other Phronesis Projects; viz., [Agora](/agora/) and [Janus](/janus/) projects. At the base of all three projects is *phronesis*, Greek for practical wisdom. There is a [different source of insight](/theory/) that backs up phronesis, but the goals of the Projects are all the same: inform action with phronesis.

Praxis derives from the Greek for "practical wisdom in action."

We can measure how much practical wisdom each of us has, and public servants can use that measure to hold themselves accountable to their constituents.

This Project uses the Small Phronesis Measure instrument. Individuals answer 48 questions and receive a score that positions their current skill with virtue and morality on a country-wide scale. Answers to those survey questions help guide personal development.
