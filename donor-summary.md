## What Our 509(a)(2) Status Means

Phronesis Project is recognized by the IRS as a **501(c)(3) public charity** under section **509(a)(2)**. This means we are funded primarily by community contributions and program revenue, not by a single foundation or investment income. Because of this broad public support, we are officially classified as a public charity—not a private foundation.

✅ **Your gifts are fully tax-deductible** (subject to IRS rules).
✅ **We remain accountable** through annual IRS filings (Form 990 series).
✅ **Public support drives our mission**, keeping us rooted in the community.
