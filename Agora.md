> The **Agora’s emphasis is the cultivation of collective intelligence grounded in trust, truth, and practical wisdom.**

### Pronunciation of Agora
The emphasis in **“Agora”** is on the **first syllable**:
**Á-go-ra** — /ˈæɡərə/
So it’s pronounced **AG-uh-ruh**, not _uh-GO-ra_ or _uh-GOR-uh._
It comes from the ancient Greek ἀγορά (_agorá_), meaning a public gathering place or marketplace — the center of civic life.

One gathering place for citizens of Sisters, Oregon is Fika Sisters, a coffeehouse.

One reason for attending periodic gatherings is to play a game we call "I Have a Question."

Our first gathering will be on October 16, 2025. We post a sign at the counter a week before the event.
