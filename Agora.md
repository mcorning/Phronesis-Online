## The Agora Project
The **Agora’s emphasis is the cultivation of collective intelligence grounded in trust, truth, and practical wisdom.**

<blockquote class="callout pronunciation">
  <h4><em>Agora</em></h4>
  <p>
    The emphasis in <strong>“Agora”</strong> is on the <strong>first syllable</strong>:<br>
    <strong>Á-go-ra</strong> — <code>/ˈæɡərə/</code><br>
    Pronounced <strong>AG-uh-ruh</strong> (not <em>uh-GO-ra</em> or <em>uh-GOR-uh</em>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Etymology &amp; sense:</strong> From ancient Greek <em>ἀγορά</em> (<em>agorá</em>) — the public
    gathering place or marketplace; the center of civic life, assembly, and exchange of ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Project nuance:</strong> We use <em>Agora</em> for open, public-facing dialogues and community
    deliberation spaces — a “marketplace of questions” where citizens meet to reason together.

### There's A New Game in Town
One gathering place for citizens of Sisters, Oregon is Fika Sisters, a coffeehouse.

One reason for attending periodic gatherings is to play a game we call "I Have a Question."

Our first gathering will be on October 16, 2025. We post a sign at the counter a week before the event.
