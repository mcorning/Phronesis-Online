<blockquote class="callout pronunciation">
  <h4><em>Janus</em></h4>
  <p>
    The emphasis in <strong>“Janus”</strong> is on the <strong>first syllable</strong>:<br>
    <strong>Ja-nus</strong> — <code>/ˈdʒeɪnəs/</code><br>
    Pronounced <strong>JAY-nuhs</strong> (English). Classical Latin <em>Jānus</em> had a long <em>ā</em> (<code>[ˈjaː.nus]</code>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Etymology &amp; sense:</strong> From Latin <em>Jānus</em>, the Roman god of doorways, thresholds,
    and transitions—facing “both ways” (beginnings/ends). January is named after him.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Project nuance:</strong> We use <em>Janus</em> for systems that look both “back” and “forward”:
    reconciling past cash flows while forecasting future obligations—an operational gateway for decision-ready finance.

The Janus Project focuses on one critical challenge for human behavior: **the wise use of money**.

The Janus Project's first focus is on a community especially challenged by money issues: Social Security Income recipients.

The Project includes an important second dimension to wise money management: bi-weekly mortgages.

And finally, Janus enables the wise acquisition and distribution of non ordinary income such as self-employment.
