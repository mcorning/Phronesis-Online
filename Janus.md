The Janus Project focuses on one critical challenge for human behavior: the wise use of money.

The Janus Project's first focus is on a community especially challenged by money issues: Social Security Income recipients.

The Project includes an important second dimension to wise money management: bi-weekly mortgages.

And finally, Janus enables the wise acquisition and distribution of non ordinary income such as self-employment.
