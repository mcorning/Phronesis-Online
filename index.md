# The Phronesis Project

**A nonprofit initiative for ethical technology and civic education.**

Our mission is to cultivate practical wisdom — _phronesis_ — in the design, use, and governance of emerging technologies. We aim to help individuals, organizations, and communities reason well and act justly in a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, digital media, and algorithmic power.

> *“Our Rabbit Warren is more than a burrow. It’s a living structure of shared meaning, shaped by each member's journey.”*
