# Entropy

Entropy is no longer seen as mere disorder—it evolves through our dialogues as a model of uncertainty, a spark for creativity, and a contextual layer that primes reasoning.

## Key Evolutions
- **Entropy as Uncertainty**: Initial treatment aligned with classical thermodynamics and information theory.
- **Entropy as Creativity**: Seen as a precondition for generative thought—disorder invites structure.
- **Entropy as Prior Context Layer**: Most recent framing: the end-state of one reasoning round becomes the *prior* of the next.

## Unasked Questions
- What role does entropy play in Bayesian priors?
- Can entropy be quantified epistemically in a Topiq graph?
- How does entropy relate to 'forgotten' chats that produced memory?

status:
  - What is the state of entropy in current cognitive models? → open
  - Can we visualize entropy over time across Topiqs? → deferred

## Notes
This Topiq is used as a test case for recursive idea evolution, memory compression, and the emergence of epistemically fertile reasoning.
