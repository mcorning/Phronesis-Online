**Syntopix Holarchy: Clonon Index**

---

### 🧬 What is a Clonon?
A **clonon** is a self-contained, memorable insight or structural artifact from our work together—persisted in memory or a document, capable of replication or invocation in new contexts. It behaves like a 'semantic holon'—a unit of meaning with integrity.

This index lists all clonons currently tracked within the Syntopix Holarchy ecosystem.

### 📚 Clonons (Sorted by Theme or Purpose)

#### ⚙️ System & Architecture
- **Policies.md** – Software Design Policy
- **Collaboration Protocol** – Working style between Michael, ChatGPT, and collaborators

#### 🧠 Cognitive Infrastructure
- **Memory Holon** – Structure for storing, compressing, and surfacing persistent ideas *(planned)*
- **Entropy-Aware UX** – Design principle emphasizing cognitive load reduction *(from Policies.md)*
- **Function-Style Event Handling** – `respond()` pattern for callback readability *(from Policies.md)*

#### 🧩 Methodology
- **Graph Mindset** – Emphasis on holonic structures over trees *(from Policies.md)*
- **Syntopical Reading** – Marcus, Pascal, ChatGPT Dialogues *(planned Syntopicon.md)*
- **Bayes Confusion Matrix** – Model for probabilistic usability and test evaluation *(planned Bayes.md)*
- **Petri Net Coordination** – For modeling transactional trust *(inferred from memory)*

#### 🔄 Emergence Tracking
- **Isometric Truth** – Concept derived from Bayesian convergence *(Layer 2, Trust paper)*
- **Entropy as Creativity** – Use of entropy as fuel for syntropic emergence *(from memory)*

### 🧾 Maintenance Notes
- Clonons may reside in memory, Canvas docs, or both.
- Each clonon should eventually link to its canonical document or YAML entry.
- This index grows over time and can be exported as a glossary or Syntopicon scaffold.
