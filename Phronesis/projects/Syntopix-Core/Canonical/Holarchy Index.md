**Syntopix Holarchy: Internal Document Index**

---

### 🗂️ Purpose
This index tracks all persistent documents in the Syntopix Holarchy—design docs, protocols, models, and plans. It is the internal architecture of the project: the scaffolding that holds the holarchy together.

---

## 📄 Canonical Documents
- [[Policies.md]] – Software design principles: clarity, exports, entropy, holons
- [[Collaboration Protocol]] – How Michael, ChatGPT, and Shea collaborate on design and writing
- [[Clonon Index]] – List of core reusable ideas and structures (semantic holons)
- [[Holarchy Index]] – (This file) Registry of all internal documents in Syntopix

---

## 🧪 Planned / Suggested
- [[UI_Policy.md]] – UX guidelines, entropy-aware design, navigation patterns
- [[Holarchy_Graph.md]] – Architecture of holons, Topiqs, edges, and emergent links
- [[MemoryHolon.md]] – Protocol for memory compression, recall, and surfacing
- [[Syntopicon.md]] – Syntopical reading guide, Topiq clustering, 100 Great Ideas
- [[Importer.md]] – How we convert markdown, Pascal, and logs into Topiqs
- [[Bayes.md]] – Probabilistic modeling and Bayes Confusion Matrix applications

---

### 🔧 Maintenance Notes
- Only Canvas documents are listed here.
- Each document should state its own scope and version status.
- This file is always the authoritative table of contents for the Holarchy itself.
