# Anonymous Reasoning

The value of a Topiq should not rest on the authorâ€™s name, but its **fitness, fertility, and ability to survive reasoning**.

## Supporting Insight
This Topiq formalizes the Syntopix model of **trust-by-structure**: ideas that can be reasoned with, updated, and connected without invoking reputation.
