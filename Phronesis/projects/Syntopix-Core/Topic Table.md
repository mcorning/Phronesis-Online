```dataview
TABLE title, created, summary, topiqx
WHERE type = "topiq"
SORT created ASC
```

---

### ðŸ§  Explanation:
- This filters and structures the results by your frontmatter fields

---

Once pasted:
- Save the note
- Dataview will automatically render the live table from your `.md` files
- You can copy that to Excel or use it to drive your `chat_index.csv`

Let me know when the table appears and weâ€™ll build the export pipeline next!
