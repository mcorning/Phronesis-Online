# 📁 Syntopix Holarchy Vault

Welcome to your personal Syntopix Holarchy knowledge system, powered by [[Obsidian]] and organized as a living, evolving holarchy of ideas, documents, and models.

## 📚 Folder Structure

### `/Indexes/`
Contains your core index and registry notes:
- `Holarchy Index.md`: Canonical table of contents with wikilinks to all project documents.
- `Syntopix Holarchy Index.md`: A user-edited version that may reflect personal naming, priorities, or layout preferences.

### `/Stubs/`
Placeholder notes for planned or upcoming documents, including:
- [[Bayes]]
- [[Holarchy_Graph]]
- [[Importer]]
- [[MemoryHolon]]
- [[Syntopicon]]
- [[UI_Policy]]

These stubs provide structure and serve as writable canvases for future expansion.

## 🧭 Navigation Tips

- Use `[[wikilinks]]` throughout the vault for fast internal navigation.
- Headings (##) in notes are collapsible—use them to structure long files.
- Enable “Automatically update internal links” in Obsidian settings to preserve link integrity when reorganizing folders.

---

## 🛠 Authoring Convention

- Canonical documents live in `/Indexes` and serve as the official specification of systems, protocols, and models.
- Stubs can be renamed or moved once they are filled in and elevated to “created” status.
- Updates to the Holarchy Index should reflect all new canonical documents.
