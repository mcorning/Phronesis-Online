# Deck Fire Mitigation Brief (With Diagrams)

## 1. Deck-to-Wall Flashing

**Purpose:** Prevent flame or ember intrusion where the deck meets the house.

```
   Siding
     |
     |   <-- 2"+ vertical rise
  ____|________________
 |    |  Metal Flashing|
 |    |----------------|
 | Deck Ledger         |
 |_____________________|
        ^ 1" overhang
```

- Vertical rise: **≥ 2 inches**
- Horizontal overhang: **≥ 1 inch**
- Continuous flashing along all deck-to-wall contact points.

---

## 2. Underside Protection

**Purpose:** Prevent embers from accumulating or igniting structural elements.

```
 Deck Joists
 -------------------------
 |                       |
 |   1/8" Metal Mesh     |
 | (Fully Enclosing)     |
 |_______________________|
     ^ Fine mesh blocks embers
```

- Required for decks **<4 ft** above grade.
- Use **1/8-inch metal mesh** or non-combustible paneling.

---

## 3. Railing/Stair Connections

**Purpose:** Remove direct fuel pathways into siding.

```
 House Siding
 |           |
 |  Flashing |<- Metal break
 |___________|
     ||
     || Railing/Step
```

- Maintain **1-inch separation** OR install metal flashing between wood and wall.

---

## 4. Fence-to-House Break

```
House ----[Metal Flashing]---- Fence
```

- Convert last **5–8 ft** to metal or composite.
- OR insert metal flashing where fence meets siding.

---

## 5. Ground Clearance

```
Siding
||  6" minimum clearance
||____________________ Soil
```

- Maintain ≥ **6”** clearance between soil/duff and siding.

---

## 6. Zero-Combustible Rule (0–5 ft Zone)

Everything burns except gravel and concrete. Keep:

- No lumber
- No plastic totes
- No stored gear
- No fuel cans
- No firewood

---

## 7. Deck Surface Cleanliness

- Sweep needles/leaves weekly during fire season.
- Remove debris from gaps between deck boards.
