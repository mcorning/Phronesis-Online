## Three Structural Fire Breaks Every Homeowner Can Deploy

### 1. Ember Grate (Mesh First Board)
- Replace first deck board with 6" metal mesh.
- Eliminates ember traps at wall.
- Enhances drainage and airflow.
- Complements flashing and reduces ledger ignition risk.

### 2. Deck Sprinklers (Pre‑Evacuation)
- Place oscillating sprinklers on decks before leaving.
- Maintains surface moisture above ignition threshold.
- Creates steam boundary layer that extinguishes embers.
- Cools siding and reduces flame attachment.

### 3. Open All Deck Gates
- Prevents rails from forming continuous combustible pathways.
- Creates a fuel discontinuity between railing and siding.
- Eliminates dead-air pockets where embers stagnate.
- Enhances water distribution from sprinklers.
