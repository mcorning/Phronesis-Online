# Wildfire Deck Mitigation Crosswalk
### Alignment of Allstate • Deschutes County WUI • NFPA 1144 • IBHS/CalFire

This table shows where all four systems agree, differ, or add detail.  
Use this as your authoritative reference when speaking to Commissioners.

---

## 1. Deck-to-Wall Flashing
| Standard | Requirement | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Allstate** | Requires flashing where deck touches siding | No height specified, but expectation follows industry standards |
| **Deschutes County WUI** | Non-combustible flashing at all deck/landing interfaces | Matches CalFire guidance |
| **NFPA 1144 (5.2.4)** | Noncombustible or ignition-resistant material required at deck-to-wall joints | Height not dictated, but flashing *implied* |
| **IBHS / CalFire** | **2” vertical rise**, **1” horizontal overhang**, continuous flashing | This is the de facto national standard |

**Interpretation:**  
Everyone requires flashing; **IBHS/CalFire provide the numeric spec** (2" rise, 1" overhang).

---

## 2. Deck Underside Enclosure (<4 ft)
| Standard | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Allstate** | Decks <4 ft must be enclosed with **1/8" metal mesh** or fire-resistant material |
| **Deschutes County WUI** | Decks close to ground must be enclosed with **non-combustible screening** |
| **NFPA 1144 (5.3.2)** | Eliminates “ember traps”; recommends enclosure with noncombustible material |
| **IBHS / CalFire** | **1/8-inch metal mesh**, fully enclosed, no combustibles |

**Interpretation:**  
All systems align.  
**1/8” metal mesh** is the unifying specification.

---

## 3. Railing/Step Attachment to House
| Standard | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Allstate** | Requires flashing or break; flags direct contact as hazard |
| **Deschutes County WUI** | Non-combustible separation or flashing at attached components |
| **NFPA 1144** | Attached combustible structures must be isolated from siding |
| **IBHS / CalFire** | **1” minimum separation OR flashing** |

**Interpretation:**  
Use **1-inch separation or flashing** as the unifying rule.

---

## 4. Fence-to-House Break
| Standard | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Allstate** | Requires flashing between combustible fence and siding |
| **Deschutes County WUI** | Requires noncombustible break at fence connections |
| **NFPA 1144 (5.3.5)** | Fences must not provide direct flame path to structure |
| **IBHS / CalFire** | Convert last **5–8 ft** to metal or insert flashing at house |

**Interpretation:**  
All four agree:  
**No combustible fence directly touches the house.**

---

## 5. Ground Clearance Below Siding
| Standard | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Allstate** | Calls out debris and duff against siding |
| **Deschutes County** | Requires minimum clearances above grade |
| **NFPA 1144** | Requires removal of vegetative fuels along foundation |
| **IBHS / CalFire** | **6-inch minimum** vertical clearance |

**Interpretation:**  
Use **6 inches minimum** as the standard.

---

## 6. Debris Management (Roof, Gutter, Deck)
| Standard | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Allstate** | Requires removal of all vegetative debris on roof, gutters, decks |
| **Deschutes County** | Matches general defensible-space rules |
| **NFPA 1144 (4.3.2)** | Remove leaves, needles, and flammables from all surfaces |
| **IBHS / CalFire** | Identical — emphasis on **embers collecting in corners, gaps** |

All four align 100%.

---

## 7. 0–5 Foot Ignition Zone
| Standard | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Allstate** | Zero combustibles in 0–5 ft (woodpiles, lumber, equipment) |
| **Deschutes County WUI** | Matches state WUI code: **noncombustible zone** required |
| **NFPA 1144 (7.2)** | Zone must be entirely free of combustibles |
| **IBHS / CalFire** | The “Immediate Zone”: **nothing combustible in 0–5 ft** |

Unanimous agreement.  
This is the **highest-priority mitigation zone** across all frameworks.

---

## Unified Standard (Recommended for County Adoption)
1. **Flashing:** 2” rise, 1” overhang  
2. **Mesh Enclosure (<4 ft decks):** 1/8" metal mesh  
3. **Railing/Stairs:** 1" separation OR flashing  
4. **Fence:** Noncombustible break or flashing; no direct contact  
5. **Ground Clearance:** 6" minimum  
6. **Debris:** Roof/gutters/deck clear at all times  
7. **0–5 ft Zone:** Absolute non-combustible buffer  

This unified list is compatible with every agency, insurer, and national standard.
