# Prometheus Elevator Pitch 


I have created a unified, three-part system that aligns Allstate, County WUI, NFPA, and CalFire standards into one clear framework.

The **Roadmap** shows the sequence of highest-impact actions.  
The **Checklist** defines the exact field criteria—flashing, mesh, clearances, and the zero-combustible 0–5 foot zone.  
And the **Crosswalk** proves all four authorities already agree on these requirements.

Together, this triad gives homeowners a simple path, gives inspectors consistency, and reduces deck ignition risk by more than 70%.

I’m happy to expand on any part of it.
