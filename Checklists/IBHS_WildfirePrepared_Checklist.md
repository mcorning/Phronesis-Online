> This Markdown is a faithful, Obsidian‑ready rendering of the current **Wildfire Prepared Home™ – How‑To Prepare My Home Checklist** from IBHS. It groups items by zone and component, using concise, actionable bullets. (No nested objects; flat lists only.)

## Immediate Zone (0–5 ft) – *Required*
- Create and maintain a **0–5 ft non‑combustible buffer** around all structures and attachments (sides, corners, entry steps, porches). Use gravel/rock/bare soil; **no mulch, plants, or stored items**.
- **Move woodpiles, propane grills/tanks, furniture cushions** and other combustibles **outside 0–5 ft**.
- Keep **roofs, gutters, ledges, decks, and stairs free of debris** (leaves/needles/twigs).
- **Fencing attached to the home:** install a **non‑combustible section (≥5 ft)** where fencing meets the structure.
- **Garage door weather‑seal** intact on all sides; replace if damaged/worn.

## Openings & Vents – *Required*
- **Screen all vents** (eave/soffit, attic, gable, foundation/crawlspace, dryer, roof) with **1/8‑inch metal mesh** or an **ember‑resistant vent** listed by the manufacturer.
- **Windows/doors/screens** in good repair; consider **dual‑pane/tempered** upgrades where feasible.
- **Seal gaps** at roof‑wall intersections, siding‑trim joints, and other ember entry points.

## Roof & Gutters – *Required*
- **Class A roof covering** (or assembly) on the primary structure and attached garage when reroofing.
- **Repair/replace loose or missing shingles/tiles**; install/maintain **metal flashing** at roof‑to‑wall intersections.
- **Gutters and downspouts**: non‑combustible materials preferred; keep **free of debris**.

## Decks, Porches & Under‑Structures – *Required (when present)*
- **Remove all stored items** and debris from **under decks/porches**.
- Where feasible, **enclose or screen** the underside with **1/8‑inch metal mesh**; eliminate vegetation and combustibles below and immediately around.
- **Deck boards and gaps** kept **clean of accumulations**; relocate **combustible furniture** away from the house during Red Flag events.

## Intermediate Zone (5–30 ft) – *Vegetation Management*
- **Separate trees and shrubs** to interrupt direct flame paths; remove **ladder fuels** by pruning lower branches (≈ 6–10 ft from ground, or lower for small trees).
- Maintain **mowed/green lawns**; replace **high‑resin plants (e.g., juniper)** and **wood/bark mulch** near structures.
- **Relocate lumber/equipment/vehicles** away from structures; keep this zone **lean, clean, and green**.

## Extended Zone (30–100+ ft) – *Fuel Reduction*
- **Thin trees** to create spacing between crowns; dispose of **slash, dead/dying trees**, and heavy downed limbs.
- Maintain **driveways/access routes** clear of flammable vegetation; ensure **address numbers visible**.
- Keep **propane/fuel tanks** cleared **≥10 ft** around and free of vegetation.

## Preparedness & Red Flag Readiness
- During **Red Flag Warnings or extended absences**, **stage hoses**, remove patio combustibles, and close **all windows/doors**.
- Review **evacuation routes**, emergency contacts, and enroll in **county alert systems**.

## Documentation (for designation or insurer)
- Keep **dated photos** of each completed item (before/after where possible).
- Retain **receipts/invoices** for materials and contractor work.
- Maintain an **annual maintenance log** for debris clearing and vegetation management.

**Notes**  
- This file reflects the current **Wildfire Prepared Home** guidance and checklist structure. For certification, follow the official checklist and photo requirements in the program materials.
- Terminology: “Required” denotes items needed to achieve a designation where applicable; vegetation items are strongly recommended and often required in high‑risk regions.
