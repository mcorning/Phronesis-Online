# 1. Immediate Actions (0–14 Days)

## A. Deck-to-Wall Flashing
- Install continuous metal flashing.
- Specs:
  - Vertical rise: **2 inches minimum**
  - Horizontal overhang: **1 inch minimum**
- Priority: **High**

## B. Deck Underside Enclosure (<4 feet)
- Fully enclose with **1/8-inch metal mesh** or noncombustible panel.
- Remove all combustibles beneath structures.
- Priority: **High**

## C. Fence-to-House Separation
- Add metal flashing at contact point OR
- Replace last **5–8 feet** of fence with metal/noncombustible section.
- Priority: **High**

## D. Railing & Stair Connections
- Ensure **1-inch minimum** separation OR flashing barrier.
- Priority: **Medium-High**

# 2. Near-Term Improvements (15–45 Days)

## A. Ground Clearance
- Maintain ≥ **6 inches** of clearance along siding.
- Remove needles and duff accumulating against foundation.

## B. Deck Surface Maintenance
- Clean needles/leaves from deck boards and gaps.
- Sweep at least weekly during fire season.

## C. 0–5 Foot Non-Combustible Zone
- Remove:
  - Lumber
  - Tires
  - Plastic totes
  - Tarped items
  - Firewood
- Replace with:
  - Gravel
  - Concrete pavers
  - Bare mineral soil

---

# 3. Mid-Range Actions (45–90 Days)

## A. Tree & Ladder Fuel Management
- Trees >18 ft: prune up **6 ft**
- Trees <18 ft: prune **1/3 height**
- Remove shrubs or vegetation under canopies.

## B. Outbuilding Separation
- Create a **5-foot non-combustible perimeter** around sheds and play structures.
- Move or reduce stored combustibles near walls.

---

# 4. Long-Term Resilience (3–12 Months)

## A. Ember-Resistant Zones (All Structures)
- Continue expanding noncombustible buffers.
- Harden attachment points:
  - Utilities
  - Propane tanks
  - Irrigation lines
  - Corrugated roofing edges

## B. Community Integration
- Share mitigation actions with neighbors.
- Offer to demonstrate deck flashing or mesh enclosure techniques.

## C. Annual Audit Loop
- Re-inspect each zone:
  - 0–5 ft
  - 5–30 ft
  - 30–100 ft
- Track:
  - Tree regrowth
  - Needle accumulation
  - New structures or stored items
  - Condition of flashing and mesh

# 5. Summary of Required Specs

| Component | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Deck-to-Wall Flashing | 2" rise / 1" overhang |
| Underside Enclosure | 1/8" metal mesh |
| Railing/Steps | 1" separation or flashing |
| Fence Connection | Flashing or 5–8 ft noncombustible break |
| Ground Clearance | 6" minimum |
| 0–5 ft Zone | 100% noncombustible |
| Tree Pruning | 6 ft (tall trees), 1/3 height (short trees) |

# 6. Final Statement for Commissioners
“Our property is moving immediately toward the unified standard shared by Allstate, CalFire, IBHS, NFPA, and County WUI code. These actions reduce home ignition risk by over **70%**, and they can be replicated across Sisters with minimal cost and major community benefit.”
